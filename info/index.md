About Rune
==========

I was born in 1983, in a small town north of Copenhagen. Things were different back then. The household technology consisted of a landline phone, a TV, and an electronic calculator. This changed drastically with the arrival of the computer, and like many other kids, my brother and I were intuitively drawn to it. We learned the buttons on the keyboard by playing digger. We learned our first english words playing Monkey Island 1. Then along came the internet, and that tiny computer in our living rooms became a portal to the rest of the world.

I've started my own design agency in Denmark, developed interactive features for the New York Times, and taught graduate classes at the Interactive Telecommunications Program at New York University. I now spend most of my time working for O'Reilly Media, while running a small art studio.
