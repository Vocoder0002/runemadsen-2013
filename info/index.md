About Me
========

My name is Rune Skjoldborg Madsen. I was born in 1983 in a town a little north of Copenhagen, Denmark. Things were different back then. Our household technology consisted of a landline phone, a TV, and an electronic calculator. From one day to the next this changed drastically with the arrival of the computer, and like many other kids, my brother and I were intuitively drawn to it. We learned the buttons on the keyboard by playing digger. We learned our first english words playing Monkey Island 1. Then along came the internet, and that tiny computer in our living rooms became a portal to the rest of the world.

If I had been born 10 years earlier, my interest for visual form would probably have led me to the field of print design. Instead my first experience with graphic design was purely computational. I was writing HTML tags instead of drawing things on paper. At the time, the simplest way of doing design with code was by building websites, so I became really good at this. Unfortunately, the only place to make money building websites was in advertising. I wasn't particularly fond of the division between creatives and coders, nor did I care much about optimizing sales for Coca-Cola.

I quit advertising and moved to New York to start graduate studies at the Interactive Telecommunications Program, a program focused on the intersection between technology and art. My two years at ITP was a journey towards an understanding of what it actually means to use the computer as a creative tool

I've started my own design agency in Denmark, developed interactive features for the New York Times, and taught graduate classes at the Interactive Telecommunications Program at New York University. I now spend most of my time working for O'Reilly Media, while running a small computational art studio.
