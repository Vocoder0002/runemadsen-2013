> Meta-design is much more difficult than design; itâ€™s easier to draw something than to explain how to draw it. - Donald Knuth, The Metafont Book

This is the first of hopefully many posts describing something I see as a continuing trend in the design world: The rise of the meta-designer, and the use of algorithmic design systems.

Until recently, the term *Graphic Designer* was used to describe artists with their roots firmly planted in the fine arts. Aspiring design students graduated with MFA degrees, and their curriculums were based on traditions from painting, sculpture and architecture: The concepts of form, color and composition were introduced through manual exercises, like the paper-based color experiments from Josef Alber's *The Interaction of Color*. At best, this teaches the designer not to be dictated by their given tool. At worst, the designer is institutionalized to think of themselves as an ideator, as a direct opposite to a technical person. Paul Rand famously said: *"It's important to use your hands. This is what distinguishes you from a cow or a computer operator"*. This echoes much of what I was taught early on in my career.

This has obviously changed with the advent of computers (and the field of web design in particular), but not to the degree that one would expect. Despite recent efforts in defining digital-first design vocabularies, like [Google's Material Design](http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html), the legacy of the printed page is still all around us. Even the most adept companies are organized around principles inherited from desktop publishing, and when the lines are drawn, we still have either *Design* or *Engineering* departments. Products start as static layouts in the former and become dynamic implementations in the latter. Designers use tools modeled after manual processes that came way before the computer, while engineers work in text-based environments. 

I think that this is about to change in a fundamental way, and inspired by Donald Knuth, I'm calling this the transition from design to meta-design. In a traditional design practice, the designer works directly on a product for delivery. Be it a logo, website, or a set of posters, the designer is the instrument to produce the final deliverable. A meta-designer works to distill this instrumentation into a design system, often written in software, that can create the final product. Instead of drawing it, she is explaining the system how to draw it. These systems can then be used, with different content and variable outputs, to generate a range of design products without much effort. As a simple example, consider these two logos for the Jewish Museum in New York.

<div class="wide-750">
  <img src="{% asset_path blog/jewish.jpg %}" />
</div>

The older logo on the left is a classic, static design product. The new logo by [Sagmeister & Walsh](http://www.sagmeisterwalsh.com/) on the right is just one output from a design system that can be used to [generate a multitude of design products](http://www.sagmeisterwalsh.com/work/project/jewish-museum-identity/). 

I believe this to be an important evolution in the design profession, and there are several factors that has lead me to this conclusion.

<ol class="bignums">

  <li><span class="bignum">1</span><strong>Design products are becoming increasingly complex.</strong> As our world turns  digital, the need for static designs goes away. Our deliverables are now complex systems (even when the output is not digital LINK TO STUFF), and for these, it's hard to say where the design stops and the technical implementation begins. <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2012/02/walter_isaacson_steve_jobs">Design is how it works</a>. For even the simplest of data visualizations, the design process itself is hours of work in languages like R, Julia or Python. When your content is data, poking around in Photoshop simply makes no sense. In some way, it's the direct opposite of design: prettifying without context. Visual thinking is increasingly done in code, and there is not much you can do if you can't program. I expect this to only become clearer as the demands for our design products increase.</li>

  <li><span class="bignum">2</span><strong>A new generation of designers</strong>, who grew up with the internet, is starting to occupy important design positions. For these designers, programming is a natural tool for creating the design products they desire, and their creative process is often built on a very systematic approach to design. They find grid systems and spacing much easier to code than to draw in Photoshop, and only fully appreciate color models when exploring them in a 3D space. They are as talented in composition and layout as in programmatic design patterns, and find the divide between the creative and technical processes problematic. This means that they often struggle to work in environments that enforce a traditional <em>art director</em> hierarchy. Most important of all, they use code to liberate themselves from the manual techniques enforced upon them from traditional design software.</li>
  
  <li><span class="bignum">3</span><strong>An expanding set of algorithmic design tools</strong> now provide an better level of entry for many aspiring designers, who wouldn't ordinarily think of themselves as programmers. Even though IDE's for designers are still suprisingly few and lacking in features (an argument fit for a blog post in itself), 

</li>

  <li><span class="bignum">4</span><strong>MOST IMPORTANT. Design is a system.</strong> History of systems in design. The fundamentals of graphic design are very objective. gerstner. Brockmann. Swiss design. New tendencies.

    (there's a bunch of this). !!!! Design is not a manual thing. To fully appreciate color, one must explore the color model. Josef muller brockmann books. Brand manuals</li>


  <li>This is already happening. Sagmeister+Walsh, mit logo.

</ol>

What does this enable?
Variable outputs
Less labor after the fact
Dynamic designs. The idea is in code, but can be variable.

There's an interesting line in Ed Catmull's book on Pixar, Creativity Inc, where he describes how animators we reluctant to use modern equipment. Wanted to do it like Disney. They forgot taht disney was relentless in pursuing new technology, and had it been available, it would have been used. The same goes for graphic design.

I AM NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT WEB DESIGN.
Tendency can already be seen with traditional design agencies like Sagmeister+Walsh.

!! DESCRIBE THE NEW THING !! I use the word meta-design to describe this: Someone who is as good at systems than at design.


Difficulties: 

- This makes hiring easier.
- Becoming a talented software engineer takes years of practice. The same can be said of designers.
- It's not a terrific process to code your designs.

I am not arguing against specialization, nor am I saying that the left/right brain phenomena doesn't exist. But it's a fact that many new designers consider code as their tool, as a painter sees a brush. The term *programmer* is not a technicala term any more. It's a tool like the pen, and we can't use it do divide people into groups.


The future is owned by....

Something about NOT coding is the new literacy. Read through and say "modeling" instead?

This has drastic implications to education and the structure of our organizations. Disruption in inevitable.

I have a plan to start writing my book.


Things to say:

What is meta-design?
How does a designer learn to program?
