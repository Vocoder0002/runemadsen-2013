This is the first of hopefully many posts describing something I see as a continuing trend in the design world: The rise of the meta-designer and algorithmic design systems.

> "Meta-design is much more difficult than design; itâ€™s easier to draw something than to explain how to draw it" - Donald Knuth, The Metafont Book

Until recently, the term *Graphic Designer* was used to describe artists with their roots firmly planted in the fine arts. Aspiring design students graduated with MFA degrees, and their curriculums were based on traditions from painting, sculpture and architecture: The concepts of form, color and composition were introduced through manual exercises, like the paper-based color experiments from Josef Alber's *The Interaction of Color*. Paul Rand famously said: *"It's important to use your hands. This is what distinguishes you from a cow or a computer operator"*. At best, this teaches the designer not to be dictated by their given tool. At worst, the designer is institutionalized to think of themselves as an ideator, as a direct opposite to a technical person. 

This has obviously changed with the advent of computers (and the field of web design in particular), but not to the degree that one would expect. Despite recent efforts in defining digital-first design vocabularies, like [Google's Material Design](http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html), the legacy of the printed page is still all around us. Even the most adept companies are organized around principles inherited from desktop publishing, and when the lines are drawn, we still have either design or engineering departments. Products start as static layouts in the former and become dynamic implementations in the latter. Designers use tools modeled after manual processes that came way before the computer, while engineers work in text-based environments. I think that this is about to change in a fundamental way, and like Donald Knuth, I'll call this a transition from design to meta-design.

So what is meta-design? In a traditional design practice, the designer works directly on a design product. Be it a logo, website, or a set of posters, the designer is the instrument to produce the final deliverable. However, a meta-designer works to distill this instrumentation into a design system, often written in software, that can create the final product. Instead of drawing it, she is programming the system to draw it. These systems can then be used, with different content and variable outputs, to generate a range of design products without much effort.

Consider these logos for two concert halls in Portugal. The logo on the left is a classic, static design product. On the right is 4 variations of a logo designed by [Sagmeister & Walsh](http://www.sagmeisterwalsh.com/). It was generated by logo software written specifically for the concert hall, which can be used to [generate endless variations of the logo](http://www.sagmeisterwalsh.com/work/project/casa-da-musica-identity/).

I believe this to be an important evolution in the design profession, and there are several factors that has lead me to this conclusion.

    <strong>Design products are becoming increasingly complex.</strong> As our world turns  digital, the need for static designs goes away. Our deliverables are now complex systems, and for these, it's hard to say where the design stops and the technical implementation begins. <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2012/02/walter_isaacson_steve_jobs">Design is how it works</a>. For even the simplest of data visualizations, a design process means hours of work in languages like R, Julia or Python. When your content is data, poking around in Photoshop simply makes no sense. In some way, it's the direct opposite of design: prettifying without context. Visual thinking is increasingly done in code, and there is not to do if you can't program. As the demands for complec design products increase, it will make less and less sense to separate design and implementation.

    <strong>A new generation of designers</strong> is starting to occupy important design positions in the U.S and abroad. For these designers, programming is a natural tool for creating the design products they desire, and their creative process is often built on a very systematic approach to design. They are as visually talented as technical proficient, and see the technical process as an accelerator for creativity, and a way to liberate themselves from the manual techniques enforced upon them from traditional design software. Therefore, they often struggle to work in environments that enforce a traditional division of labor.

    <strong>An expanding set of algorithmic design tools</strong> now provide a better level of entry for many aspiring designers, who wouldn't ordinarily think of themselves as programmers. Even though IDE's for designers are still suprisingly few and lacking in features (an argument fit for a blog post in itself), there are now hundreds of libraries and frameworks for creating designs in code. We're also seeing a proliferation of educational material aimed at visual thinkers. Recent publications for just a single one of these projects, <a href="https://processing.org/">Processing</a>, include <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Processing-Programming-Handbook-Designers-Artists/dp/026202828X/ref=sr_1_6?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1406934187&amp;sr=1-6&amp;keywords=processing">books</a>, <a href="http://icm.shiffman.net/0.0/">videos</a>, <a href="http://natureofcode.com/book">websites</a>, and <a href="http://hello.processing.org/">interactive learning environments</a>, most of them freely accessible on the internet.

    <strong>Systems are an important part of our design history</strong>. I find this point extremely important, as it's something I realized rather late in my design education. Even though design can seem like an extremely subjective profession, the fundamentals of design are not, and <a href="http://printingcode.runemadsen.com/lecture-intro/">the history of graphic design is full of artists using rules or systems</a> in their creative process. Even before the computer was a household item, Karl Gerstner wrote a book called <em><a href="http://runemadsen.com/blog/karl-gerstner-designing-programmes/">"Designing Programmes"</a></em>, outlining many of these exact ideas. But now we are at a point in history where these "programs" can be more than theoretical instructions for a manual workflow. We have the ability to write algorithmic systems that create designs, and the designer of the future will need to understand how to deliver on that promise.

SPECULATE ON WHAT THE FUTURE WILL BE LIKE
- education will need to change
- a new era of design companies will arise
- I'm talking about much more than data visualization or web design.

There's a few indicators that this future is already here. [Some design companies](sagmeisterwalsh.com) are actively exploring similar themes. Academic institutions make this a focus for [new publications](http://www.amazon.com/Dynamic-Identities-Cultural-Public-Context/dp/3037781637). Independent design magazines are [writing](http://www.dot-dot-dot.us/) [about](http://www.servinglibrary.org/) these trends.
