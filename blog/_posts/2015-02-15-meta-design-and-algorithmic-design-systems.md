> Meta-design is much more difficult than design; itâ€™s easier to draw something than to explain how to draw it. - Donald Knuth, The Metafont Book

This is the first of hopefully many posts describing something I see as a continuing trend in the graphic design world: The rise of the meta-designer, and the use of algorithmic design systems.

Until recently, the term *Graphic Designer* was used to describe artists with their roots firmly planted in the fine arts. Aspiring design students graduated with MFA degrees, and their curriculums were based on traditions from painting, sculpture and architecture: The concepts of form, color and composition were introduced through manual exercises, like the paper-based color experiments from Josef Alber's *The Interaction of Color*. At best, this teaches the designer to not be dictated by their given tool. At worst, the designer is institutionalized to think of themselves as an ideator, as a direct opposite to a technical person. Paul Rand famously said: *"It's important to use your hands. This is what distinguishes you from a cow or a computer operator"*. This echoes much of what I was taught early on in my career.

This has obviously changed with the advent of computers (and the field of web design in particular), but not to the degree that one would expect. Despite recent efforts in defining digital-first design vocabularies, like [Google's Material Design](http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html), the legacy of the printed page is still all around us. Even the most adept companies are organized around principles inherited from desktop publishing, and when the lines are drawn, we still have either *Design* or *Engineering* departments. Products start as static layouts in the former and become dynamic implementations in the latter. Designers use tools modeled after manual processes that came way before the computer, while engineers work in text-based environments. 

I believe that this is about to change in a fundamental way. 

!! DESCRIBE THE NEW THING !! I use the word meta-design to describe this: Someone who is as good at systems than at design.

There are several factors that has lead me to this conclusion.

<ol class="bignums">

  <li><span class="bignum">1</span><strong>Design products are becoming increasingly complex.</strong> As our world turns  digital, the need for static designs goes away. Our deliverables are now complex systems written in code, and for these, it's hard to say where the design stops and the technical implementation begins. <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2012/02/walter_isaacson_steve_jobs">Design is how it works</a>, and anyone who has worked with a talented meta-designer would probably agree. For even the simplest of data visualizations, the design process itself is hours after hours of work in languages like R, Julia or Python. When your content is data, poking around in Photoshop simply makes no sense. In some way, it's the direct opposite of design: prettifying without context. Visual thinking is increasingly done in code, and there is not much you can do if you can't program. This will only continue as the demands for our design products increase.</li>

  <li><span class="bignum">2</span><strong>New generation of designers.</strong> Grew up on the internet. I know plenty of designers that just don't fit in those boxes. They simply can't work under the old world regime. </li>
  
  <li><span class="bignum">3</span><strong>New tools.</strong> Third, a number of new programming environments now provide an excellent level of entry for many people who wouldn't ordinarily think of themselves as programmers.</li>

  <li><span class="bignum">4</span><strong>MOST IMPORTANT. Design is a system.</strong> History of systems in design. The fundamentals of graphic design are very objective.

    (there's a bunch of this). !!!! Design is not a manual thing. To fully appreciate color, one must explore the color model. Josef muller brockmann books.</li>

</ol>

I call this meta-design... borrowed from Donald Knuth.
A shift away from these old workflows towards a world, towards a world where there is no clear separation between the creative and the technical.


Difficulties: 

- This makes hiring easier.
- Becoming a talented software engineer takes years of practice. The same can be said of designers.
- It's not a terrific process to code your designs.


The future is owned by....

This has drastic implications to education and the structure of our organizations. Disruption in inevitable.

I have a plan to start writing my book.
