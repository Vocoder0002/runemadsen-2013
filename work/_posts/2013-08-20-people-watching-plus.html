excerpt: |
  A common phrase in any metropolis is the term "people watching." By creating sidewalk barricades made up by home-made cardboard cones and yellow stick tape, people are challenged to either adapt to or defy this unofficial element on street. This project was a collaboration with [Scott Wayne Indiana](http://www.39forks.com), [Nik Psaroudakis](http://www.addictivelabs.com/) and Nien Lam.
