excerpt: |
  Tiny Artists 4-6 is the second generation of the Tiny Artists project, where a series of small computer programs generate and print graphic posters, after which they delete themselves and their own source code. The printed graphics are the only originals. While series 1-3 explored computational form, this series investigates color theory.

    <h2>Tiny Artists 4-6</h2>
    <div class="long-description">
      <p>"Tiny Artists" is a series of small computer programs that print graphic posters according to their individual style, taste, and current mood. Each program is born with a short lifespan and can only create a limited number of works. A program will then delete itself and leave no digital trace of itself or its creations. The printed graphics are the only originals. "Tiny Artists" is a simulation of the commissioning of artists, a story of life and death in software, and a comment on the originality of art in the digital world.</p>
      
      <p>The programs are written in Processing, and are programmed to run only once. They will then output a series of 9 original graphic posters, print them, delete the digital files, and lastly delete their own source code. It's an attempt to create an original artwork in computational design, and are printed using archive quality Ultrachrome ink on fine art paper.</p>
      
      <p>While the <a href="/work/tiny-artists">first series of prints</a> explored the use of generative form, this series explored color theory.</p>

      <p>These prints were shown as a part of the <em>Everything is Temp</em> gallery exhibition at the <a href="http://tempartspace.com/">TEMP Art Space</a> in Tribeca, Manhattan.</p>
