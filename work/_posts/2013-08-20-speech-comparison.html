    <h2>Speech Comparison</h2>
    <div class="long-description"><p>The speech comparison data visualization is a sketch built in <a target="_blank" href="http://processing.org/">Processing</a>. It parses words from 9 famous speeches and displays the results in a custom diagram. All words are arranged in the right-hand side, ordered by the number of times they appear in the speeches. Each word has an arc divided into 9 colors representing the speakers. By looking at these arcs, you can see the word-use percentages of all speakers.</p>

<p>The design is inspired by works shown in the early <a target="_blank" href="http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=graphis">Graphis Diagrams</a> books. The sketch uses <a target="_blank" href="http://www.robertpenner.com/easing/">Robert Penners easing equations</a> ported to Processing for animation.</p>

<p>By pressing keys 1-9 you can highlight a single speech to get an overview of the word-use. Pressing the number 0 will show all the speeches again. Pressing space will reset the sketch and show the arc animation from the beginning.</p>
