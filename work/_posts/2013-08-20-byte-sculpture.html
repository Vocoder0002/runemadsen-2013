excerpt: |
  This light sculpture reads a written text, half a byte at the time. It is a comment on the principles of language as data, and a reference to binary languages like morse code and computational programming. This project was a collaboration with [Don Miller](http://no-carrier.com/) and [Peter Holzkorn](http://holzkorn.com/).
