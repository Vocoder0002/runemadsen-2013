      <p>Spare some change for a Machinosh Classic? "I Used To Be Somebody" is a comment on our consumption of technology. The video features an old Machintosh Classic 2 standing outside the Apple Store. Equipped with a face-tracking webcam in the floppy drive it's desperatly looking at people passing by, asking for spare change to survive.</p>

      <p>This project is inspired by <a href="http://stewd.io/w/jed">JED's Other Poem</a> by <a href="stewd.io">Stewart Smith</a> and is a collaboration with <a href="http://www.39forks.com">Scott Wayne Indiana</a>.</p>
